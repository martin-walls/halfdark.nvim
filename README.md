# Halfdark Color Scheme for Neovim

Spiritually inspired by [tonsky's Alabaster theme for Sublime Text](https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster).
Colours are based on Atom's One Dark theme.

## Language Support

The following languages are explicitly supported by the colorscheme. Other languages will of course work but the highlighting may be less accurate.

- C#
